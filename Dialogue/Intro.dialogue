It's strange isn't it?
I never thought I'd see you again.
However, you always have been quite persistent.
I wish I could say the same for our new friend.
They're currently having... [wait=1.0] a hard time waking up.
Could you please do me a favor and wake them up for me?
You: Yes.
Soul: Wonderful! May THY HUSK! service you well.
