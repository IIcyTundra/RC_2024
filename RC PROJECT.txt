-ION/// Productions(inc.) is a mainly military company where their HQ is located downtown of a neon lit city
--ION/// Is mainly focus on robotic military capabilities, enforcing robotic entities to replace humans on war fronts
---(Hypothetically) funded in response to recent war
--Robots should integrate easily with human ranks (soldier, medic) able to work with humans and their own kind
---ION/// has a medical branch with streamlined creation of human cells(Ex: tech to easily patch one's open wounds)

-an Accident at ION/// Productions(inc.) where scientists wanted to reach greater integration with technology with help of AI, AI had hard coded mistake where it designated enemies quickly.
--AI is able to reprogram robotic entities, used streamlined creation of human cells to give robotic entities a more almagimation look to give the different classes a unique look
---AI not able to be reprogrammed as it quickly took hold of facilities and staff

-The event left the town evacuated while ION/// made a deal with the government to clean up the mess since they still want the AI for research purposes.
